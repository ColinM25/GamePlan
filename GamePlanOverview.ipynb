    "**Game Plan** is a comprehensive tool designed to assist sports enthusiasts in finding the optimal game to attend on the road by analyzing key travel and ticket costs. By leveraging advanced techniques such as web scraping, database management, and mathematical optimization, Game Plan identifies the most cost-effective travel plans for attending sports events, ensuring fans get the best value for their experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we focus on the **2024 NFL Wild Card Round**. This set of games has been chosen because scheduling and matchup information is already available. High-intensity playoff games are the highlight of any sports season, and this example will showcase how Game Plan identifies the most cost-effective game to attend based on a specified home airport location.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this report, the **2025 NFL Schedule** has not yet been released, so optimization for a preferred team's road games is not currently possible. However, the ultimate goal of **Game Plan** is to empower fans to plan their travel ahead of each season. This tool will help users explore new cities while cheering on their favorite teams, all while keeping their travel budget in mind.\n",

    "To start, we have a web scraper that collects flight data from a chosen departure airport. The scraper is written in Python and uses libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Datetime to search and gather **Google Flights** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the [flight web scraper](./flight_webscraper.ipynb) notebook to collect flight data from Google Flights. Simply modify the following variables to generate data for each NFL host city:\n",

    "### Hotel Data\n",

We can hopefully implement additional constraints and trade-off analysis that can balance budget-friendly with high stakes matchups.\n",
