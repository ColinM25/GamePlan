    "\n",
    "**Game Plan** is a comprehensive tool designed to assist sports enthusiasts in finding the optimal game to attend on the road by analyzing key travel and ticket costs. By leveraging advanced techniques such as web scraping, database management, and mathematical optimization, Game Plan identifies the most cost-effective travel plans for attending sports events, ensuring fans get the best value for their experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we focus on the **2024 NFL Wild Card Round**. This set of games has been chosen because scheduling and matchup information is already available. High-intensity playoff games are the highlight of any sports season, and this example will showcase how Game Plan identifies the most cost-effective game to attend based on a specified home airport location.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this report, the **2025 NFL Schedule** has not yet been released, so optimization for a preferred team's road games is not currently possible. However, the ultimate goal of **Game Plan** is to empower fans to plan their travel ahead of each season. This tool will help users explore new cities while cheering on their favorite teams, all while keeping their travel budget in mind.\n",

    "## **6. Conclusion** ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation of the travel optimization tool provides a useful starting point for streamlining travel plans for NFL games. The results from both **Scenario 1** and **Scenario 2** illustrate how different sets of parameters (budget, number of travelers, team selection) influence the optimization process and the resulting travel plans. The following outlines key areas for future expansion and improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Real-Time Data**\n",
    "   - Integrating real-time data on flight availability, hotel prices, and ticket sales would enhance the accuracy of the recommendations. This would ensure that users are provided with the most up-to-date options, improving the tool’s relevance and effectiveness. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Booking Integration**\n",
    "- Expansion could involve integrating the tool with booking websites and platforms, enabling users to seamlessly book their flights, hotels, and tickets directly from the recommendations provided, streamlining the entire travel planning and purchasing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Additional Travel Considerations**\n",
    "   - Including transportation options between the airport, hotel, and stadium (e.g., rental cars, public transportation) would create a more holistic travel plan. Some cities may be more expensive to travel within and could affect the true cheapest travel options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **User Customization**\n",
    "   - Allowing users to provide specific preferences (e.g., airline choices, flight times, hotel stars, seat sections) would create a more personalized experience. The system could prioritize these preferences while still optimizing costs, giving users more control over their travel plans. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "By incorporating these advanced features, the project has the potential to evolve into a fully comprehensive travel planning platform. While the current tool is initially focused on optimizing travel plans for NFL games, its core functionality can be extended to cover a wide range of sports events and even general travel planning. This would empower users to make well-informed decisions, ensuring they get the most value from their travel experiences. More specifically, users would be able to plan their travel well in advance, targeting their favorite teams and the most exciting matchups throughout the season. Not only would they be able to attend games, but they could also explore new destinations, combining their passion for sports with the opportunity to visit new cities and experience their unique culture, all while ensuring a cost-effective and personalized travel experience."
