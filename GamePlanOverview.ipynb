    "**Game Plan** is a comprehensive tool designed to assist sports enthusiasts in finding the optimal game to attend on the road by analyzing key travel and ticket costs. By leveraging advanced techniques such as web scraping, database management, and mathematical optimization, Game Plan identifies the most cost-effective travel plans for attending sports events, ensuring fans get the best value for their experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we focus on the **2024 NFL Wild Card Round**. This set of games has been chosen because scheduling and matchup information is already available. High-intensity playoff games are the highlight of any sports season, and this example will showcase how Game Plan identifies the most cost-effective game to attend based on a specified home airport location.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this report, the **2025 NFL Schedule** has not yet been released, so optimization for a preferred team's road games is not currently possible. However, the ultimate goal of **Game Plan** is to empower fans to plan their travel ahead of each season. This tool will help users explore new cities while cheering on their favorite teams, all while keeping their travel budget in mind.\n",

    "In the **2024 NFL Wild Card Round**, there are six exciting matchups, each presenting a potential travel destination for fans eager to experience the thrill of playoff football. The home teams represent the host cities for this round, which include:\n",

    "For the **2024 NFL Wild Card Weekend**, we analyzed data from six host cities.
