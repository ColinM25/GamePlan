    "\n",
    "Pathfinding is a critical concept in robotics, game development, and autonomous navigation. This project first uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path on a map and then applies QP (Quadratic Programming) to smooth the route. In game maps, a smooth path can make character movement more natural and visually appealing. For example, in the game Baldur’s Gate, players click on a destination, and the character autonomously chooses the optimal path to reach the clicked location. Sharp turns can make character movement appear rigid. This project will use maps from Baldur’s Gate II for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* algorithm is a highly popular pathfinding algorithm that helps find the shortest distance between two objects. The algorithm uses a heuristic that measures the cost from the current position to the destination position. "

    "The A* (A-star) algorithm is a widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is designed to find the shortest path between a start node and a goal node in a weighted graph. A* combines the strengths of both Dijkstra's algorithm (which guarantees the shortest path by exploring all nodes) and greedy best-first search (which makes decisions based on heuristic estimates of the goal). This hybrid approach allows A* to efficiently find the optimal path while minimizing the search space, making it particularly suitable for real-time applications like video games. The above plot demonstrates the purpose for A* and serves as a basis for what we hope to implement within a game-environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper understanding of how the A* algorithm works, you can refer to the work by Yumeng Yan, who discusses its practical applications in his paper.\n",

    "The images above illustrate the ultimate goal of our model. In the first image, we visualize obstacles (depicted in black), set within a game map, that our model must navigate through smoothly and efficiently. Using the A* algorithm, our system will identify the shortest path between the start and goal points, which we then further optimize using a Quadratic Programming (QP) approach to smooth the route. This is demonstrated in the second and third images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second image, you can clearly observe the path that the A* algorithm has determined across the map. The third image provides a closer look at how our smoothing optimizer enhances this path by focusing on a zoomed-in section, where the smoothed path is represented in blue. This smoothing process is crucial in making the movement more natural within the game environment. Unlike the rigid, four-way movements often seen in games, our approach offers flexibility, enabling characters to move fluidly in all directions, enhancing realism and gameplay experience.\n",

    "The map data used for this project was sourced from [Moving AI](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html), which provides downloadable game maps for testing and development. While our primary focus is on Baldur's Gate, there are additional game maps available, offering opportunities for future adaptations of the model to other games as well."

    "From our scatter plot we can observe how the A* algorithm works through the Baldur's Gate map. When given the start point, our pathing seems to be close to the quickest path to the destination. While this is a great visualization, we more importantly want to focus on the smoothing optimization we have created to make the game pathing more realistic. In order to do so, we will focus on a few different specific sections of the Baldur's Gate map to get a better idea of how our optimization operates around objects and upon the optimal pathing. "

    "Given these 3 subsets of the map, we can observe more closely how our smoothing optimizer makes the game movement more realistic. For Section 1, there are long sweeping turns which stand out as opposed to rigid 90 degree turns. In Section 2, our smoothing optimizer very closely avoids an obstacle but still manages to hug it, minimizing proximity loss while also making movement more realistic."

    "\n",
    "After completing our path smoothing optimization project using Baldur's Gate II maps as our testing ground, we successfully demonstrated how combining A* pathfinding with optimization techniques can transform rigid grid-based paths into smooth, natural-looking trajectories. Our implementation revealed that a smoothness weight (α) of 1.0 and proximity weight (β) of 0.1 provided an effective balance between path smoothing and maintaining efficient routes. Testing on different map segments, particularly in regions (300,350,200,250) and (250,300,150,200), showed that our approach successfully eliminated unrealistic sharp turns while preserving the strategic advantages of optimal pathfinding. The improvement was especially noticeable around obstacles, where our solution created naturally flowing paths instead of the jagged movements typical in traditional grid-based systems. This enhancement directly addresses a common criticism of classic RPGs where character movement often appears artificial and constrained by the underlying grid system.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key finding from our implementation was the careful balance needed between smoothness and path adherence. When we increased the smoothness weight relative to the proximity weight, the paths exhibited more gradual curves but sometimes deviated too far from optimal routes. This trade-off proved particularly important in game environments, where both movement aesthetics and path efficiency affect player experience. Our segment-based processing approach, using segments of 10 points, successfully managed computational complexity while maintaining path quality across different map regions. Through our experimentation with different parameter combinations, we discovered that local path characteristics significantly influenced the optimal balance between smoothness and proximity constraints. In areas with dense obstacles, stronger adherence to the original path proved beneficial, while open areas benefited from increased smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking toward future developments, an interesting direction would be to implement adaptive parameter tuning based on local path characteristics. Such a system could automatically adjust smoothing parameters based on obstacle density and path complexity, increasing path adherence in crowded areas while allowing for smoother movements in open spaces. This enhancement would be particularly valuable for modern game remakes, where players expect sophisticated character movement while still maintaining strategic depth. By analyzing local environmental conditions, the system could create more context-aware paths that better balance the competing needs of natural movement and efficient navigation. Additionally, this approach could be extended to consider dynamic obstacles and varying terrain types, further enhancing the realism of character movement while preserving the tactical elements that make games like Baldur's Gate engaging. The success of our current implementation provides a strong foundation for these future improvements, demonstrating the potential for optimization techniques to enhance classic game mechanics while meeting modern player expectations."
